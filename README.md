This is part of The Odin Project Course.

It's a tic-tac-toe game using javascript module pattern.

I had some issues using the module pattern since I'm not used to it and I'm pretty sure I didn't use it properly, because I only used 2 modules but at least the internal variables are protected and a user cant change the score using the console.
